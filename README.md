# Using Reproducibility in Machine Learning Education: Reproducibility with Incomplete Methodology Descriptions

This work was done under [UCSC OSPO](https://ospo.ucsc.edu/) summer of reproducibility and is a part of the project **Reproducibility in machine learning Education** which aims to develop interactive educational materials about reproducibility in machine learning for use in graduate and undergraduate classes. 
*** 

This repository Contains:

- **Hypothetical research paper**: This paper was written during this project and has been designed in a way to leave many details ambiguous, All these ambiguous details have been obtained by going through different machine learning research papers. The ambiguity in methodology has been designed in a way that the person who is going to reproduce the results has to make choices at a point and that choice may or may not effect the results.

- **Notebooks**: The notebooks are designed in a way that they cover all the choices and at the end of each notebook you are left with two choices of notebooks, which decided that what choices you made under a given scenario.

All the specific details regarding running the notebook are mentioned in each of the notebooks.
