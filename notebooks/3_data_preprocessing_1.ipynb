    "# Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last Notebook we obtained train.csv and test.csv file, these files contains raw data and the data preprocessing step will act as a bridge between raw data and the final result which we are focused to achieve. Data preprocessing can have a major impact on the final results so it’s crucial to thoroughly understand what the authors did and how you could follow the same strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our understanding of the paper, The author did these three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Encoding the labels: A machine learning model always needs a number as input instead of raw text data, so label encoding is a crucial step here.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sampling for full few shot Learning : The full few shot setup requires 10 samples for each label, so the author randomly took 10 samples from the dataset. it’s important to make sure that you are picking unique samples. Since the author is experimenting on a 3 fold data so we will pick 30 samples and make 3 fold dataset with 10 samples each.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Data Augmentation : The next step which author followed was implementing the data augmentation strategy and then apply the same of the previously selected 10 samples for each intent. Again the augmentation will be applied on 3 fold dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are done with the above three steps we will store the data and make it available for use in the next part of Reproducibility."
