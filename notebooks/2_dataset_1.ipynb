    "If you are on this notebook then you have made a choice in the previous section to go ahead with **CrossValidation-Data**. Let’s understand in more depth what is inside this dataset directory.\n",

    "The first directory (autoGeneFromRealAnno/:) contains generated trainset and testset from the annotated csv file. The other four subdirectories (out4ApiaiReal, out4LuisReal, out4RasaReal and out4WatsonReal) in CrossValidation/ are the converted NLU service input data for Dialogflow, LUIS, Rasa and Watson respectively. So we will only be picking the first directory for our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the directory “autoGeneFromRealAnno” we have 10 fold data among which we wcan choose any of the fold to train but for now we can go ahead with 1st fold. Inside First fold we have train and test directory respectively and inside the repositories we have 64 csv files which contains intent data for each of the 64 intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will try to collect the data and store it in a pandas dataframe and then a csv file.\n",
