    "## Getting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of machine learning, the data you use is like the building blocks of your model. Good data can help your model perform really well and give useful results, while not-so-good data can lead to results that don’t really make sense or aren’t very accurate. So, having good, reliable data is super important because it’s what your model learns from and it can make a big difference in how well your model works and the results it gives you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, when it comes to **reproducing** any kind of result, the role of data is incredibly crucial. If you’re not using the exact same data as the original study, it becomes quite challenging to achieve precisely the same outcome. Data forms the foundation for outcomes, and even small differences in the data used can lead to variations in results. Therefore, the accuracy and similarity of data used for reproduction play a vital role in ensuring the consistency and reliability of the outcomes.\n",
