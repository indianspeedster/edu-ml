    "\n",
    "-   Sampling for full few shot Learning : The full few shot setup requires 10 samples for each label, so the author randomly took 10 samples from the dataset. it’s important to make sure that you are picking unique samples. Since the author is experimenting on a 3 fold data so we will pick 30 samples and make 3 fold dataset with 10 samples each.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Data Augmentation : The next step which author followed was implementing the data augmentation strategy and then apply the same of the previously selected 10 samples for each intent. Again the augmentation will be applied on 3 fold dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Tokenization : The last step in this notebook will be to tokenize the data, since machine learning model only understands numerical form of data, so it’s necessary to make the data in the form of tokens and this process is known as tokenization.\n",

It’s important to follow the exact same preprocessing pipeline to ensure that the data is consistent and prepared in the same way as in the original study.
