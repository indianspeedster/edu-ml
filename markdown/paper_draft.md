# Impact of data augmentation on intent classification using full few-shot learning.
## Abstract: 
This research paper uses a powerful technique called full few-shot learning to explore how data augmentation affects intent classification. Intent classification is about understanding the purpose of a sentence or text. With full few-shot learning, we can make the model work even when we have very little training data. In our experiments, we used a BERT Large model and only ten examples for each intent. Then, we tried adding more examples through data augmentation to see if it makes the model better. While the impact of data augmentation was not huge, the small improvement it brought was still significant. The extra examples helped the model recognize new intents better. This study shows how data augmentation can be helpful in intent classification, even with limited training data
