## Next Steps:

Now we have completed all the steps needed before training a model, The next step is Training the model and obtaining the final result. But wait, the author talked in the paper in Training and evaluation section that they did hyperparameter tuning but they never mentioned that they did it on all three models or just the largest model. Again why this doubt comes because if they are comparing then are they comparing it on the same ground or the models specific performance ?

So again now we are left with two choices

- Hyperparameter tuning on the largest model

- Hyperparameter tuining on all three models

It's upto you that what you are picking, below we have two notebook each with a different choice. Pick your own adventure and see how similar are your results.

-   [Notebook(Hyperparameter tuning on the largest model)](/5_model_training_1.ipynb)

-   [Notebook(Hyperparameter tuining on all three models)](/5_model_training_2.ipynb)
